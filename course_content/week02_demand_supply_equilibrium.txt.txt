# Week 2: Demand, Supply, and Market Equilibrium

## Core Concepts

- **Quantity Demanded (Qd)**: Amount consumers are willing and able to buy.
- **General Demand Function**: Qd = f(P, M, PR, T, PE, N)
  - P: Price of the good (negative relationship)
  - M: Consumer income (positive for normal goods, negative for inferior goods)
  - PR: Price of related goods (positive for substitutes, negative for complements)
  - T: Tastes and preferences (positive)
  - PE: Expected future price (positive)
  - N: Number of consumers (positive)

- **Direct Demand Function**: Qd = f(P), holding other variables constant.

- **Quantity Supplied (Qs)**: Amount producers are willing and able to sell.
- **General Supply Function**: Qs = f(P, PI, Pr, T, Pe, F)
  - P: Price of the good (positive)
  - PI: Input prices (negative)
  - Pr: Related goods in production (sign depends on substitute vs complement)
  - T: Technology (positive)
  - Pe: Expected future price (negative)
  - F: Number of firms or capacity (positive)

- **Equilibrium**: Market clears where Qd = Qs. Changes in determinants shift demand/supply and affect the equilibrium price and quantity.

- **Price Ceilings and Floors**:
  - Price Ceiling < equilibrium → Shortage
  - Price Floor > equilibrium → Surplus

## Key Formulas

- **General Demand (Linear Form)**:
  Qd = a + bP + cM + dPR + eT + fPE + gN

- **General Supply (Linear Form)**:
  Qs = h + kP + lPI + mPr + nT + rPe + sF

- **Equilibrium**:
  Solve: Qd = Qs for equilibrium P and Q

## Worked Example

**Q: Suppose demand is Qd = 100 – 2P and supply is Qs = 20 + 3P. What is the equilibrium price and quantity?**

Set Qd = Qs:

100 – 2P = 20 + 3P  
→ 80 = 5P  
→ P = 16  
→ Q = 100 – 2(16) = 68

**Answer: Equilibrium price is $16, equilibrium quantity is 68 units.**

## Graphical Insights (Described)

- Demand curve slopes downward; supply slopes upward.
- Shift in demand → moves the entire demand curve.
- Movement *along* demand/supply = change in quantity demanded/supplied.
- Simultaneous shifts in supply and demand: Direction of P or Q may be indeterminate.

**2. Which of the following shifts the supply curve rightward?**  
A. Higher input prices  
B. Improved production technology  
C. Increase in expected future price  
D. Fewer firms in the market  
**Answer:** B

**3. If income rises and demand for ramen noodles falls, ramen is most likely a:**  
A. Normal good  
B. Luxury good  
C. Inferior good  
D. Giffen good  
**Answer:** C

**4. What is the likely effect of a binding price ceiling?**  
A. Surplus  
B. Shortage  
C. Equilibrium  
D. No effect  
**Answer:** B

**5. When both demand and supply increase, equilibrium quantity will:**  
A. Always rise  
B. Always fall  
C. Remain unchanged  
D. Rise, but price effect is indeterminate  
**Answer:** D

## Additional Teaching Notes

- Emphasize difference between “change in demand” (shift) vs. “change in quantity demanded” (movement).
- Use real-world examples (e.g., gas prices, tech markets) to illustrate determinants.
- Highlight policy relevance of price controls (e.g., rent ceilings, minimum wage).
