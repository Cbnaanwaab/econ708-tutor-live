# Week 6: Demand Estimation and Forecasting

## Core Concepts

### 1. **Direct Methods of Demand Estimation**
- **Consumer Interviews**: Quick but prone to response bias, inaccurate recall, and sampling issues.
- **Market Studies**: Controlled simulations where price is varied to isolate effects on quantity.
- **Lab Experiments**: Volunteers simulate buying behavior.
- **Field Experiments**: Real-life consumer response under manipulated variables.

### 2. **Empirical Demand Functions**
- Derived from actual market data:
  Q = f(P, M, PR, N)
  - P: Price of the good  
  - M: Income  
  - PR: Price of related good  
  - N: Number of consumers  

- Linear form:  
  Q = a + bP + cM + dPR + eN  
  - b: negative (law of demand)  
  - c: positive (normal good) or negative (inferior good)  
  - d: positive (substitute) or negative (complement)

### 3. **Elasticity Estimation**
- Coefficients in linear demand can be transformed into elasticities at given values of P and Q.

### 4. **Log-Linear Demand Models**
- ln(Q) = ln(a) + b·ln(P) + c·ln(M) + d·ln(PR) + e·ln(N)  
- Elasticities are constant:  
  - b: price elasticity  
  - c: income elasticity  
  - d: cross-price elasticity

### 5. **Firm-Level Demand Estimation Steps**
1. Specify demand function for the firm  
2. Collect data on price, income, substitutes, etc.  
3. Estimate parameters using regression

### 6. **Time-Series Forecasting**
- Models quantity (Qt) as a function of time (t)
  - Linear trend: Qt = a + bt  
  - If b > 0: increasing sales; b < 0: decreasing sales

### 7. **Seasonal (Cyclical) Variation**
- Controlled by adding **dummy variables**:
  - D₁, D₂, ..., Dₖ for k seasonal periods (only k–1 needed)
  - Dummy = 1 if observation falls in that season, else 0

### 8. **Forecasting Cautions**
- Forecast accuracy decreases with time horizon (wider confidence intervals)
- Model misspecification (e.g., omitted variable, wrong functional form)
- Forecasts cannot anticipate sudden market shocks or structural changes

## Key Formulas

- **Linear Demand**: Q = a + bP + cM + dPR + eN
- **Log-Linear Demand**: ln(Q) = ln(a) + b·ln(P) + c·ln(M) + d·ln(PR) + e·ln(N)
- **Linear Trend Forecast**: Qt = a + bt
- **Seasonal Model with Dummy Variables**: Qt = a + bt + D₁ + D₂ + ... + Dₖ₋₁

## Worked Example

**Q: A log-linear demand model estimated as ln(Q) = 6.2 – 1.5·ln(P) + 0.4·ln(M)**  
- **Price elasticity** = –1.5 (elastic)
- **Income elasticity** = 0.4 (normal good, not a luxury)

**Q: Forecast sales for t = 20 given Qt = 500 + 20t → Qt = ?**  
Qt = 500 + 20·20 = **900 units**

## Graphical Insights (Described)

- **Linear Trend**: upward/downward sloping line fit to sales data
- **Forecast Intervals**: widening bands around forecast line as t increases
- **Seasonal Variation**: sawtooth pattern or shifting parallel lines via dummy adjustments
