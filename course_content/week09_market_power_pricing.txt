# Week 9: Managerial Decisions for Firms with Market Power

## Core Concepts

### 1. What is Market Power?
- **Market power**: Firm can raise price without losing all customers.
- Present when demand is **downward sloping** (not perfectly elastic).
- **Monopoly**: One firm, no close substitutes, high entry barriers.

> More inelastic demand → greater market power  
> Market power enables positive **economic profit** in both short and long run

---

### 2. Measuring Market Power

#### a. **Lerner Index**  
Measures markup of price over marginal cost:

L = (P – MC) / P

- L = 0 under perfect competition  
- L increases as market power increases

#### b. **Cross-Price Elasticity**  
- Positive EXY → substitutes → limits market power  
- More substitutes = higher elasticity = lower power

---

### 3. Sources of Market Power

- **Economies of Scale**: Big firms can drive prices below rival’s costs
- **Legal Barriers**: Licenses, patents, exclusive franchises
- **Essential Inputs**: Control over critical resource
- **Brand Loyalty**: Hard for new firms to gain market share
- **Switching Costs**: Lock-in prevents consumer movement
- **Network Externalities**: Value increases with more users (e.g., platforms)

---

### 4. Monopoly Decision Rules

#### a. **Short Run**
- Produce where **MR = SMC** if P ≥ AVC  
- Shut down if P < AVC

#### b. **Long Run**
- Produce where **MR = LMC** if P ≥ LAC  
- Exit if P < LAC  
- Optimal plant minimizes **LAC** at chosen Q

---

### 5. Input Hiring

- **MRP = MR × MP**
- Hire inputs until **MRP = Input Price**
- Equivalence: MRP = w ⇔ MR = MC

---

### 6. Monopolistic Competition

- Many firms with **differentiated products** and **free entry**
- **Short-run equilibrium**: Same as monopoly (MR = MC, P > MC)
- **Long-run equilibrium**: P = LAC; profit = 0  
  (entry erodes economic profit)

---

### 7. Profit Maximization Procedure (Steps)

**Step 1**: Estimate demand function (Q = a + bP + …)  
**Step 2**: Solve for **inverse demand**: P = f(Q)  
**Step 3**: Compute **Marginal Revenue (MR)** from inverse demand  
**Step 4**: Estimate **AVC** and **SMC** functions (e.g., cubic)  
**Step 5**: Solve **MR = SMC** → find Q*  
**Step 6**: Plug Q* into inverse demand → find P*  
**Step 7**: Check shutdown rule:  
- If P* < AVC(Q*) → shut down  
- Else → operate

**Step 8**: Compute profit:  
Profit = (P × Q) – (AVC × Q) – TFC  
If shutdown: Profit = –TFC

---

### 8. Two-Plant Output Allocation

If a firm operates plants A and B:

- Profit-maximizing output allocation satisfies:  
  **MR = MCA = MCB**

---

## Key Formulas

- **Lerner Index**: L = (P – MC) / P  
- **MRP** = MR × MP  
- **Profit** = TR – TC = (P × Q) – (AVC × Q) – TFC  
- **Shutdown rule**: Operate if P ≥ AVC(Q)

---

## Worked Example

**Q: A monopolist faces demand P = 100 – 2Q. Cost function is C = 20Q + 100. Find Q*, P*, and profit.**

1. MR = d(TR)/dQ = 100 – 4Q  
2. MC = dC/dQ = 20  
3. Set MR = MC: 100 – 4Q = 20 → Q* = 20  
4. P* = 100 – 2(20) = $60  
5. Profit = TR – TC = (60×20) – (20×20 + 100) = 1200 – 500 = **$700**

---

## Graphical Insights (Described)

- **MR curve** lies below demand curve for monopolist  
- **Profit-maximizing point**: MR = MC  
- **Shutdown point**: P = AVC  
- Under monopolistic competition, LR equilibrium occurs where demand is tangent to LAC
