# Week 7: Production and Cost in the Short Run

## Core Concepts

### 1. **Production Function**
- Describes the maximum output from a set of inputs given current technology.
- **Technical efficiency**: Producing the most output from a given input bundle.
- **Economic efficiency**: Producing a given output at the lowest total cost.

### 2. **Types of Inputs**
- **Variable input**: Can be adjusted in the short run (e.g., labor). Costs = Variable Costs.
- **Fixed input**: Cannot be changed in short run (e.g., leased capital). Costs = Fixed Costs.
- **Quasi-fixed input**: Required only if output > 0 (e.g., power for lighting); Cost = Quasi-fixed Cost.

| Input Type       | Paid If Q = 0? | Avoidable? | Cost Category  |
|------------------|----------------|------------|----------------|
| Variable         | No             | Yes        | Variable Cost  |
| Fixed            | Yes            | No         | Fixed Cost     |
| Quasi-fixed      | No             | Yes        | Quasi-fixed    |

### 3. **Time Frames**
- **Short run**: At least one input is fixed.
- **Long run**: All inputs are variable.

### 4. **Sunk vs. Avoidable Costs**
- **Sunk Cost**: Already incurred; cannot be recovered → **irrelevant** for decisions.
- **Avoidable Cost**: Can be prevented if activity stops → **relevant** for decisions.

### 5. **Product Measures**
- **Total Product (TP)**: Output produced with a given input.
- **Average Product (AP)** = TP / input
- **Marginal Product (MP)** = ΔTP / Δinput

> Relationship: When AP is rising (falling), MP > (<) AP. When AP is max, MP = AP.

### 6. **Law of Diminishing Marginal Product**
- As more units of a variable input are added, MP eventually declines.

### 7. **Cost Curves in the Short Run**
- **Total Cost (TC)** = TFC + TVC
- **Average Fixed Cost (AFC)** = TFC / Q → always decreasing
- **Average Variable Cost (AVC)** = TVC / Q → U-shaped
- **Average Total Cost (ATC)** = TC / Q = AVC + AFC
- **Short-run Marginal Cost (SMC)** = ΔTC / ΔQ → U-shaped

> Intersections:
- SMC = AVC at AVC’s minimum  
- SMC = ATC at ATC’s minimum  
- SMC < ATC (or AVC) when ATC (or AVC) is falling; SMC > when rising

## Key Formulas

- **AP** = TP / Input  
- **MP** = ΔTP / ΔInput  
- **TC** = TVC + TFC  
- **AFC** = TFC / Q  
- **AVC** = TVC / Q  
- **ATC** = TC / Q = AVC + AFC  
- **SMC** = ΔTC / ΔQ

## Worked Example

**Q: Suppose a firm produces 100 units with total cost TC = $900 and TFC = $300.**

- TVC = 900 – 300 = $600  
- AVC = 600 / 100 = $6  
- AFC = 300 / 100 = $3  
- ATC = 900 / 100 = $9  
- If Q increases to 101 and TC = $909 →  
  SMC = (909 – 900) / (101 – 100) = **$9**

**Q: When MP < AP, what happens to AP?**  
→ AP is decreasing.

## Graphical Insights (Described)

- **TP Curve**: Initially increasing at an increasing rate, then diminishing returns set in.
- **MP and AP**: MP peaks first, AP peaks later; MP intersects AP at AP’s maximum.
- **Cost Curves**:
  - AFC declines continuously
  - AVC and ATC are U-shaped
  - SMC intersects both AVC and ATC at their minimum points

## Additional Teaching Notes

- Use spreadsheet exercises to graph TP, MP, and cost curves.
- Connect short-run cost curves to decisions about pricing and output.
- Emphasize why marginal values drive optimization, not average values.
