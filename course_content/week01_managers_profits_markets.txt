# Week 1: Managers, Profits, and Markets


## Core Concepts

- Managerial economics applies microeconomic principles to real-world decision-making to maximize firm profit.
- Economic theory abstracts complexity to guide optimal decisions.
- Firms aim to maximize **economic profit**, not just **accounting profit**.
- **Opportunity cost** underlies both explicit and implicit costs.
- Strategic decisions (from industrial organization) shape competitive positioning, unlike routine tactics.
- The **principal-agent problem** arises when managerial incentives diverge from owner goals, leading to **moral hazard**.
- Market structures (perfect competition, monopoly, monopolistic competition, oligopoly) determine a firm’s pricing power.
- Market globalization affects firm competition and market strategy.

## Key Formulas

- **Economic Profit** = Total Revenue – (Explicit Costs + Implicit Costs)
- **Accounting Profit** = Total Revenue – Explicit Costs
- **Firm Value** = Present Value of Future Economic Profit (adjusted by a risk premium)

## Worked Example

**Q: If a firm earns $10 million in total revenue, has $6 million in explicit costs, and $2 million in implicit costs, what is the economic and accounting profit?**

- Economic Profit = 10M – (6M + 2M) = **$2M**
- Accounting Profit = 10M – 6M = **$4M**

→ The economic profit better reflects the true opportunity cost of firm resources.

## Graphical/Conceptual Insights

- **Economic vs. Accounting Profit**: Accounting ignores owner-supplied resources.
- **Principal-Agent Problems**: Asymmetric information leads to hidden actions (moral hazard).
- **Market Structures**:
  - Perfect Competition: Many firms, no pricing power.
  - Monopoly: One firm, full market power.
  - Monopolistic Competition: Many firms, product differentiation.
  - Oligopoly: Few firms, strategic interdependence.

## Additional Teaching Notes

- Emphasize the distinction between short-run and long-run profit objectives.
- Tie moral hazard to real-world corporate governance (e.g., executive compensation).
- Reinforce the firm’s **value-maximization** goal in every application.
