# Week 5: Elasticity and Demand

## Core Concepts

- **Price Elasticity of Demand (E)**: Measures % change in Qd from a 1% change in P.
  - Formula: E = (%ΔQ / %ΔP)
  - Always negative, but we interpret using the absolute value |E|.

- **Elasticity Types**:
  - Elastic: |E| > 1 → Q-effect dominates
  - Inelastic: |E| < 1 → P-effect dominates
  - Unitary Elastic: |E| = 1 → TR unchanged

- **Total Revenue (TR = P × Q) and Elasticity**:
  - If demand is elastic: price ↑ → TR ↓
  - If demand is inelastic: price ↑ → TR ↑
  - If unit elastic: TR remains constant

- **Determinants of Elasticity**:
  1. Availability of substitutes
  2. Budget share spent on the good
  3. Adjustment time

- **Alternative Elasticity Formulas**:
  - Point Elasticity (linear):  
    E = b × (P/Q), or E = (ΔQ/ΔP) × (P/Q)
  - Arc Elasticity (interval):  
    E = [(Q2 – Q1)/(Q2 + Q1)] ÷ [(P2 – P1)/(P2 + P1)]

- **Elasticity and Demand Curves**:
  - On linear demand curves: elasticity varies along the curve (more elastic at higher P).
  - For Q = aPᵇ: elasticity is constant (equal to b).

- **Marginal Revenue (MR)**:
  - MR = ΔTR / ΔQ
  - If |E| > 1 → MR > 0 (TR ↑)
  - If |E| = 1 → MR = 0 (TR max)
  - If |E| < 1 → MR < 0 (TR ↓)
  - MR for linear demand P = A + BQ → MR = A + 2BQ

- **Income Elasticity (EM)**:
  - EM = (%ΔQ / %ΔM)
  - Normal good: EM > 0; Inferior good: EM < 0

- **Cross-Price Elasticity (EXY)**:
  - EXY = (%ΔQx / %ΔPy)
  - Substitutes: EXY > 0; Complements: EXY < 0

## Key Formulas

- **Price Elasticity**: E = (ΔQ / ΔP) × (P / Q)
- **Arc Elasticity**:  
  E = [(Q2 – Q1)/(Q2 + Q1)] ÷ [(P2 – P1)/(P2 + P1)]
- **Marginal Revenue (general)**:  
  MR = P × (1 – 1/|E|)
- **Income Elasticity**: EM = (ΔQ / ΔM) × (M / Q)
- **Cross-Price Elasticity**: EXY = (ΔQx / ΔPy) × (Py / Qx)

## Worked Example

**Q: A price change from $20 to $18 causes quantity to rise from 100 to 120. Calculate arc elasticity of demand.**

E = [(120 – 100)/(120 + 100)] ÷ [(18 – 20)/(18 + 20)]  
E = (20/220) ÷ (–2/38) = 0.0909 / (–0.0526) ≈ **–1.73**

**Interpretation**: Demand is elastic over this interval.

**Q: If demand is elastic and price increases, what happens to TR?**  
TR falls because the quantity loss outweighs the price gain.

## Graphical Insights (Described)

- Elastic region is upper portion of a linear demand curve (high P).
- Inelastic region is lower portion (high Q).
- TR curve is maximized where |E| = 1 (unit elasticity).
- MR curve lies below demand; when MR = 0, TR is at max.
