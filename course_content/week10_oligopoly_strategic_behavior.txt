# Week 10: Strategic Decision Making in Oligopoly Markets

## Core Concepts

### 1. Nature of Oligopoly
- Small number of firms → **interdependent decisions**
- Each firm’s pricing/output affects rivals’ outcomes
- Strategic thinking is required → **Game Theory** is the tool

---

## 2. Game Theory Sections

### A. Simultaneous Decisions

- Firms act **without knowing rivals’ actions**
- **Dominant Strategy**: Best action regardless of rival’s decision
- **Dominant Strategy Equilibrium**: All firms choose their dominant strategies

#### Key Concepts
- **Prisoner’s Dilemma**: All firms choose dominant strategies but are worse off than if they cooperated
- **Dominated Strategy**: Never optimal → eliminate it
- **Nash Equilibrium**: Each firm chooses its best response given rivals’ decisions
- **Best-Response Curves**: Graphical version of Nash — intersect at equilibrium

---

### B. Sequential Decisions

- Firms act in **sequence** (one after another)
- Use **game trees** and **rollback (backward induction)**
- **First-mover advantage**: Going first leads to better payoff
- **Second-mover advantage**: Reacting leads to better payoff

#### Strategic Moves
1. **Commitment**: Binding yourself to a future action
2. **Threat**: “If you do X, I’ll do Y (bad for you)”
3. **Promise**: “If you do X, I’ll do Y (good for you)”
- All must be **credible** to influence outcomes

---

### C. Repeated Decisions

- **One-shot game**: No cooperation — expect cheating
- **Repeated game**: Cooperation possible via punishment strategies

#### Trigger Strategies
- **Tit-for-Tat**: Mimic last move (punish then forgive)
- **Grim Trigger**: One cheat triggers **eternal punishment**
- **Cooperation is stable** if: PV(cost of cheating) > PV(benefits)

#### Facilitating Practices
- **Price matching**: Reduces gains from undercutting
- **Sale-price guarantees**: Locks in customer price expectations
- **Public pricing**: Makes cheating easier to detect
- **Price leadership**: Leader sets price, followers match

---

### D. Strategic Entry Deterrence

- Incumbents use strategic moves to **deter entry**

#### Tactics
- **Limit Pricing**: Set price low enough to make market unattractive
- **Capacity Expansion**: Increase output capacity to threaten price cuts upon entry

> These moves change **entrants’ expectations** about profitability

---

## Key Definitions and Concepts

- **Game**: Strategic situation with interdependent payoffs
- **Nash Equilibrium**: No one has incentive to deviate unilaterally
- **Best Response**: Optimal choice given what you expect rivals to do
- **Strategic Stability**: Outcome that no one wants to change unilaterally

---

## Worked Example

**Q: Two firms face the following payoff matrix:**

| Firm B | High Price | Low Price |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| **Firm A: High Price** | 5, 5      | 1, 8     |
| **Firm A: Low Price**  | 8, 1      | 2, 2     |

- Both have dominant strategy = Low Price  
- Nash Equilibrium = (Low, Low) → Payoffs: 2, 2  
- But both would be better off choosing High (5, 5)  
→ Classic **Prisoner’s Dilemma**

---

## Graphical Insights (Described)

- **Best-response curves** intersect at Nash equilibrium  
- **Game trees** trace sequential moves and payoffs  
- **Trigger strategies** sustain cooperation over time  
- Entry deterrence shifts perceived **profit landscape** for rivals

## Additional Teaching Notes

- Use role-play or simulation games in class to illustrate dominant vs. Nash strategies  
- Reinforce difference between **simultaneous** and **sequential** moves  
- Discuss **tacit collusion** and the legal boundaries of facilitating practices  
- Connect game theory to real-world oligopolies (e.g., airlines, telecom)
