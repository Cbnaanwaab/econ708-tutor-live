-# Week 8: Managerial Decisions in Competitive Markets

## Core Concepts

### 1. Characteristics of Perfect Competition
- Firms are **price takers**: each produces a small share of total market output.
- Products are **homogeneous**.
- **Free entry and exit** in the long run.

> Demand curve for an individual firm is perfectly **elastic** at the market price.  
> **D = MR = P** for a competitive firm.

### 2. Short-Run Decisions

#### a. **Shut Down vs. Produce**
- **Shut down** if: TR < TVC or P < AVC
- **Produce** if: P ≥ AVC  
- Fixed costs are irrelevant in short-run production decisions (they’re sunk).

#### b. **How Much to Produce**
- Produce where: **P = SMC**, if P ≥ AVC
- Ignore **profit margin** (P – ATC) in determining Q*; it doesn’t maximize total profit.

#### c. **Break-even Points**
- Occur where: **P = ATC**
- At break-even, profit = 0

#### d. **Short-Run Supply Curve**
- Firm: Portion of **MC** curve above min **AVC**
- Industry: Horizontal summation of firms' supply curves → **upward-sloping**

#### e. **Producer Surplus (PS)**
- PS = TR – TVC = Area above SMC and below price
- Economic profit = PS – TFC

---

### 3. Long-Run Equilibrium

- Firms earn **zero economic profit**:  
  **P = LMC = LAC**, at LAC's minimum
- **Entry/exit** of firms ensures this outcome

#### a. Long-Run Supply Curves
- **Constant-cost industry** → LRS is **horizontal**
- **Increasing-cost industry** → LRS is **upward-sloping**
- In both cases, P = min LAC in long-run equilibrium

---

### 4. Economic Rent
- Payment to a **scarce, superior input** above its opportunity cost
- In long-run equilibrium, any potential economic profit from superior resources becomes rent paid to the resource owner
- Rent ≠ profit to the firm

---

### 5. Input Usage for Profit Maximization

#### a. **Marginal Revenue Product (MRP)**
- MRP = MR × MP = P × MP (for a price-taking firm)
- Hire input until: **MRP = Input Price**

#### b. **Average Revenue Product (ARP)**
- ARP = TR / L = P × AP
- If **ARP < input price** for all L → shut down

---

### 6. Implementation Steps (Empirical)

**Step 1:** Forecast product price (use regression/time series)  
**Step 2:** Estimate AVC and MC (e.g., use cubic cost function)  
**Step 3:** Check shut down: P < AVCmin → Q* = 0  
**Step 4:** If P ≥ AVCmin, solve P = MC to find Q*  
**Step 5:** Compute profit = TR – TC = (P – ATC) × Q

---

## Key Formulas

- **Profit** = TR – TC = (P – ATC) × Q
- **Shutdown Rule**: Produce if P ≥ AVC; else, shut down
- **MRP (Labor)** = P × MP  
- **ARP** = TR / L = P × AP
- **Break-even**: P = ATC  
- **Producer Surplus** = TR – TVC

---

## Worked Example

**Q: A firm has AVC = $12, ATC = $18, P = $15. Should it produce?**

- P = 15 > AVC = 12 → produce
- Profit = (15 – 18) × Q = –$3Q → operating at a **loss**, but covering variable costs

**Q: If MR = $30 and MP = 5, what's MRP?**

- MRP = 30 × 5 = **$150**
- If wage = $120 → hire more labor

---

## Graphical Insights (Described)

- Firm's **supply curve** is the MC curve above AVC
- Market supply = sum of firms’ MC curves
- Break-even = P = ATC → zero economic profit
- Shut-down point = min AVC

## Additional Teaching Notes

- Use numerical tables to simulate AVC/ATC curves and shut-down rules
- Reinforce the **irrelevance of fixed costs** in short-run decisions
- Draw connection between **input-based** and **output-based** optimization
