# Week 3: Marginal Analysis for Optimal Decisions

## Core Concepts

- **Optimization Problem**: Defined by an objective function (to maximize or minimize), choice variables, and constraints.
- **Net Benefit (NB)**: NB = Total Benefit (TB) – Total Cost (TC); this is the objective to maximize.
- **Marginal Analysis**: Examine small changes in the level of an activity to assess their impact on NB.
  - Marginal Benefit (MB) = ΔTB / ΔA
  - Marginal Cost (MC) = ΔTC / ΔA
- The **optimal level of activity (A\*)** occurs when: **MB = MC**
- **Continuous vs. Discrete Choices**:
  - Continuous: choose from a range of values.
  - Discrete: choose from countable activity levels.
- **Decision Rule for Discrete Choices**:
  - Increase activity if MB > MC
  - Decrease activity if MB < MC
  - Optimal is last unit where MB ≥ MC
- **Sunk Costs**: Irrecoverable and irrelevant for future decision-making.
- **Fixed Costs**: Do not change with activity level — also irrelevant for marginal decisions.
- **Average Costs**: Should not be used for optimization decisions.
- **Bang per Buck (MB/P)**: Used in constrained problems to maximize benefit per dollar.
- **Equimarginal Principle**: To allocate budget optimally across activities, set:  
  MB₁/P₁ = MB₂/P₂ = ... = MBₙ/Pₙ

## Key Formulas

- **Net Benefit**: NB = TB – TC
- **Marginal Benefit**: MB = ΔTB / ΔA
- **Marginal Cost**: MC = ΔTC / ΔA
- **Optimal Condition (Unconstrained)**: MB = MC
- **Optimal Condition (Constrained)**: MB₁/P₁ = MB₂/P₂ = … = MBₙ/Pₙ, subject to budget constraint

## Worked Example

**Q: A firm’s total benefit from advertising is TB = 200A – 5A² and total cost is TC = 10A. What is the optimal level of advertising (A)?**

1. NB = TB – TC = (200A – 5A²) – 10A = 190A – 5A²  
2. MB = d(TB)/dA = 200 – 10A  
3. MC = d(TC)/dA = 10  
4. Set MB = MC: 200 – 10A = 10 → A = 19  

**Answer: Optimal advertising = 19 units**

## Graphical Insights (Described)

- Net Benefit curve peaks at A\*
- MB and MC intersect at A\*
- Slope of TB = MB; Slope of TC = MC
- Sunk costs and fixed costs do not affect MB or MC → irrelevant for optimization

**4. If MB > MC for a given level of activity, what should the decision maker do?**  
A. Decrease the activity  
B. Hold the activity constant  
C. Increase the activity

**Answer:** C

**5. In a constrained problem, optimal allocation requires:**

## Additional Teaching Notes

- Emphasize the danger of using average cost or sunk cost logic in firm decisions.
- Draw TB, TC, MB, and MC graphs and highlight A\*.
- Use real-world cases: optimal ad budget, labor hours allocation, resource mix decisions.
